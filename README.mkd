A demo I'm writing for a friend.

Type some letters to see what happens. Only "brochures" actually works. Type it
and hit enter.

Starting it up
--------------

You'll need to have Ruby installed. I last tried this with MRI 2.4.0.

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rackup

And visit [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) to see it in action.
